<ul>
  <li>Installing the cable carrier is best delayed until later. For running the cables though it it needs to be opened. This is best done when flat on a table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Measurements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The cable carrier's lower attachment point needs to be tested out later. With the drive belts in place and the wires installed find a point that does not cause stress for the entire range of motion.</li>
