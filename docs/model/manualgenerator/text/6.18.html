<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Attach mounts to the frame loosely, mount drive shafts and idlers, then tighten.</li>
  <li>Align so that idlers are 1mm from the gantry-frame.</li>
  <li>Center stepper motor in a way to evenly distribute overlap of the drive shaft couplings.</li>
  <li>Belt tension is critical for good performance. Tension by pulling at the base of the idler screw with the shaft of a thin screw drive. Use about the force you can easily assert with your wrist only. When belt is under tension tighten idler screw.
</li>
  <li>Differential alighnment of the y-cart: Adjust by leaving one shaft coupling open, push y-cart all the way back, then tighten.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Idler T-slot nuts are of the "preassembly" kind. This makes it easier to adjust the belt tension.</li>
  <li>Shaft mounts and motor mount are all perfectly vertical.</li>
  <li>Y-cart is perpendicular to the frame.</li>
  <li>Belts do not climb pully teeth when moving slowely (avoid fast-pushing the gantry).</li>
  <li>Y-cart is horizontally constrained. Horizontal rollers have no/minimized spacing on both sides along entire range of motion (Rails may have to be adjusted to be perfectly parallel).</li>
  <li>All rollers are touching the rail without excerting exessive stress.</li>
  <li>Top rollers of y-cart are all on the same level (avoid twisting the cart).</li>
</ul>
