<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Belt tension should be without visible slack, firm enough to prevent belt from jumping on pulley, but not too firm to put unnecessary stress on mechanism.</li>
  <li>Tension by pulling at the base of the idler screw with the shaft of a thin screw drive. Use about the force you can easily assert with your wrist only.</li>
</ul>
