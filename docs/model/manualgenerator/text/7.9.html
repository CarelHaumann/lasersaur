<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All parts should be perpendicular in all directions.</li>
  <li>All rollers should grab the y-bar nicely, with good alignment.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The extrusions are perfectly vertical and horizontal, respectively.</li>
  <li>Cart runs smoothly on the bar while being constraint in all other ways. Please note that once the belt and motor is attached the motor will introduce some friction from self-induction that can easily be mis-interpreted as mis-alignment.</li>
</ul>
