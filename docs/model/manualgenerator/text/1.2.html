<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The part numbers of the aluminum extrusions show measurments for cross-section and length in mm.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Measurements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Four of the short columns need to be positioned precisely so the separation panels fit nicely. The gap to the corner columns is <mark>160mm</mark>.</li>
  <li>The two flat extrusions in the rear left carry the laser PSU. They only need to match the length of the PSU.</li>
  <li>The two flat extrusions in the rear right carry the controller board and its PSU. They only need to match the length of them</li>
  <li>Both of the above can be adjusted later.</li>
</ul>
